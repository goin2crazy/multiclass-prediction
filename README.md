# MultiClass Prediction 
This repo created by writting model training and infern process for kaggle competition. I used there the: 

XGBoost Classifier - the most better prediction score 

CatBoost Classifier 

Keras Multi-Head Architecture Model - the main idea is using the special model for each class in dataset with 'sigmoid' activation fn for model output.

Simple Keras Classification Model - Just use the 'softmax' in the output layer and SparseCategoricalCrossentopy as loss
